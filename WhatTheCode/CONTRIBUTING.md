# How to contribute ?

Hey ! Do you like What The Code ?
I think you think it's weird and BAD because it is totally UNUSELESS !
But its funny.
No ?
Yeah, it's funny.

So, if you want to contribute, you can do the following things :
1. Propose new ideas and stupid commands that can be added in the language
2. Develop your own version of the language :
* You must put the link of this repository somewhere
3. Find bugs and tell me, I'll try to fix them
4. Find new ideas for the contribution system.

That's all.
For this file.
